A library containing my standard development resources.

### Requirements

```
PHP >= 7
WordPress >= 4.8
```

The required WordPress version will always be the most recent point release of
the previous major release branch.

For both PHP and WordPress requirements, although this library may work with a
version below the required versions, they will not be supported and any
compatibility is entirely coincidental.

### Installation

To install this library, use Composer:

```
composer require thefrosty/wp-utilities:~1.1.1
```
